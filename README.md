The refactored version of the original code of the CTC by Alex Graves 2009-2010

Full project https://sourceforge.net/projects/rnnl/ was used to be working under Linux OS with LSTM network

this file is refactored version of the “TranscriptionLayer.hpp” (CTC Layer) file in which does not require any dependency from RNNLib project so that you can use it easily with any standard C++ compiler under any project.

Also, you can easily modify the code for enabling or disable the magical blank state!! for more information about this see blow article:
